# GoogleAuth
Project on doing Two-Factor Authentication with Google Authenticator protocol in ASP.NET.
Usernames and passwords saved in a project database. Cryptographic functions used to protect user data.

Code is functional, but messy, since this was a University project. If I were to do it over, I would definetely use code design patterns, stronger cryptographic functions and such.
